  Use this file to change settings for radio operation
  Stuart Robinson's Slave setting code for Sx120180 was used and modified for this application
  Modified by Dev Shrestha 04/06/2024 
  1. DIO1 pin in Sx1280 is used to indicate radio ready and connected to pin 5.
  2. All DIO pins in Nanotron is set to input (not used)
